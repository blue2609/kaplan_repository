Best park
Fantastic Park. Fabulous coustmer service we were upgraded to a villa on our arrival free of charge. Rooms were modern and clean. The facilities are second to none. There was so much for the kids to do. Cant wait to stay again!

One of the best
You will go a long way to get better. This business has been recommended to us for a long time now. Only disappointed with ourselves that we haven't visited before now. We will be back in the near future. Amaizing.

Excellent yet again. Coconut Village is excellent for my large family and the children have lots to do and are warn out by bed time. Easy to access from the Highway and close to shopping centre for food and takeaways.
