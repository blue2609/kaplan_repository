Have to say, year on year my discomfort with #MelbourneCup2018  becomes more pronounced. Which is why I am most firmly in the #NuptotheCup camp. Cruelty is cruelty doesn’t matter how flash the frock or expensive the bubbles.

this rain is bloody awesome. #nuptothecup


Wherever you are in the world, watch the 2018 #MelbourneCup live and free on Twitter! 


I  a good party... but not at the expense of another living being. 

Gambling and animals are not a great mix in my humble opinion.

137 horses died on Australian Racetracks in one racing year. Is this race a good bit of fun or is it animal cruelty? #NuptotheCup https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/melbourne-cup-one-of-the-cruellest-days-in-citys-calendar-20171106-gzfj9m.html … @smh


In my household we don’t celebrate the butchery which will be held today. We’ll study and work. Unfortunately for 1 unit of journalism I have to follow the news. We’ll cry hearing about those poor horses dying because of humans’s greed
Say #NupToTheCup #ChooseKindness
 


 

3) Researchers at the University of Melbourne discovered that more than half of the horses they studied used for racing had blood in their windpipes.

It's the one day a year that gambling and drinking to excess is encouraged, exploitation and abuse of animals is overlooked and the ogling of women is OK and this is all wrapped up neatly under a fascinator and deemed a "sport" #NuptotheCup

 

I used to bet $100 on #MelbourneCup. These days I say #NupToTheCup and donate it to @ASRC1 instead. It's not about animal cruelty. I eat meat and wear leather so to claim that would be hypocritical. It's about gambling, ugly displays of wealth and toxic gender expectations.

#NupToTheCup #NupToTheCup Horses dying for your entertainment is grotesque. The promotion of excessive gambling, drinking and then shaming women for this behaviour is grotesque. Louder for the people in the back #NupToTheCup #MelbourneCup2018    #Auspol

 

NO ANIMAL SHOULD BE USED FOR ENTERTAINMENT #NupToTheCup #HorseRacingKills #MelbourneCup 
 

 
We choose not to stop today and celebrate a horse race. Instead, we challenge the notion why "entertainment" needs to be at the expense of animal welfare. #NupToTheCup #CrueltyFree
 

Replying to @JaneCaro @FatherBob 
Yup! Lolly and I are both saying #NupToTheCup 
 
The only type of horse sport I want to watch today: #NupToTheCup 


"Opera Horse". By me. For @GOAT_aus.

On Melbourne Cup Day I do not celebrate with the nation. I prefer to remember the fallen... all the beautiful horses killed in the evil persuit of profit, gambling and "entertainment"

fuck using animals for entertainment, it’s not right #NupToTheCup


Absolutely gorgeous weather this morning. Maybe we should all stay indoors and bet on cockfighting or seal clubbing or some other form of gratuitous animal cruelty #NuptotheCup #MelbourneCup2018 pic.twitter.com/FDUrvjz5qM

I hope the rain ruins the outfits of anyone who enjoys getting dressed up and watching animals being abused #NupToTheCup

Dozens of horses have died on Australian racetracks since the last #MelbourneCup – putting a stop to this sorry excuse for a sport really can't come soon enough for my liking #NupToTheCup #HorseRacingKills

#NupToTheCup I’m off to join Martin Place with many others to talk about the dangers of horse racing. https://www.facebook.com/events/343658549725178/ …
119 racehorses died last year on Australian race tracks. This is not sport. It is not entertainment. It is not fashionable.

119 horses have died on the Australia’s horse racing tracks from 1st August - 31st July 2018.  Nup to Melbourne cup, nup to all animal racing #NupToTheCup #MelbourneCup2018
 

Verema, Admire Rakti, Araldo, Red Cadeaux, Regal Monarch and all the horses who have died on Australian racing tracks, or have been killed when their 'careers' are over.

We remember you.

I think this is so great and want to say a BIG thank you to this pub for having the courage to stand up again animal cruelty. We definitely should NOT be supporting any entertainment that uses animals.

If you participate in your workplace sweeps tomorrow, why not throw the same number of dollars at an organisation that's trying to support the welfare of racehorses? There are a number of options linked on this site: http://www.australianhorserescue.com/news/resources/thoroughbreds/ … #nuptothecup



Enjoy your public holiday, sure..... but don’t be apart of this shitty industry. 

Don’t gamble on a life. How about using that money on your next escort booking. Yeah okay, good deal.

Mercilessly whipped and pushed beyond their limits, horses experience catastophic injuries such as  musculoskeletal trauma and internal bleeding with well over one hundred horses dying ever year on racetracks. Here's why we'll be saying #NuptotheCup

So this is what they mean when they say "Australian culture" #NupToTheCup

Some of the loosest moments from past #MelbourneCup days! Bring on this year  

 

#nuptothecup The average career for racehorse is 3 years after which they r “ discarded”. Each year bw 100000-250000 horses discarded & become petfood. #youbetthrydie @MehreenFaruqi


#Horseracing You Bet They Die #NupToTheCup
