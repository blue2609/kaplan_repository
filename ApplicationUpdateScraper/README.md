Some applications on MBATS cannot be automatically managed with Chocolatey/Powershell such as:

- TIBCO Spotfire Analyst
- Exploratory Desktop

Hence, we need to scrape their application release history to see if there's a new version of their application released recently. 

Another way to do it is through RSS Feed but I haven't found any RSS feed based solution to this problem.
