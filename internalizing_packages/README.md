# Overview

This is a proof of concept that can be used to internalise data analytics applications and packages.

 Currently, this project only consists of `python_packages` but should Kaplan continue to go down this path in the future, it can be a good starting point. 

 Another thing to note here is that there is no script or coding worked on for this project yet. Currently there's only documentation so a devops specialist or a programmer can start continue working on this project in the future
